# General idea

This repo is an attempt to understand the following statement from "Programming Phoenix."

    "Templates are precompiled. Phoenix doesnâ€™t need to copy strings for each rendered template. At the hardware level, youâ€™ll see caching come into play for these strings where it never did before."

Here's my understanding so far: [Phoenix renders templates as iodata](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/blob/b7660e596efe6cd7ac711ef20172dc889f436ac2/lib/phoenix/view.ex#L334-L336), and that this means it never has to concatenate the parts of a page into a single response string. Instead, the Erlang VM can call `writev` with the iolist and let the operating system send each part of the response over the socket individually.

This means Elixir doesn't need to allocate a 2MB string in order for Phoenix to send a 2MB HTML response. That's good. But that doesn't explain the "hardware caching" part.

But I had a guess. Given that:

- `writev` is given the memory addresses in RAM of the data it should write
- a template has both static parts (like headers) and dynamic parts (eg, from a database query),
- strings are immutable in Elixir

... *maybe* hardware caching would come into play as follows:

- On first request, Phoenix renders an iolist of strings, and Cowboy calls `writev` with their memory locations.
- On Nth request, Phoenix responds with an iolist with **some of the same strings in memory** - eg, the header and footer - and these are given to `writev` as the **same memory addresses** as in the previous requests
- The operating system notices this, and says "I don't need to get that string from RAM; I already have it in CPU cache." This results in a faster response.

That was my idea. I've been trying to prove or disprove it.

##

This Phoenix app is an experiment. There are three important routes: `/static/`, `/dynamic/`, and `/tiny_template/`.

`/static/` responds using an iolist where the first element is a random string, but the rest is an unchanging list of strings.

`/dynamic/` response using an iolist that changes with each request.

Both do the same work *before* responding; they differ only in the *contents* of their response.

`/tiny_template/` renders a template with a tiny header and footer and one small dynamic string.

## Hypothesis

`/static/` may be more performant than `/dynamic/`. Because its response consists largely of the same strings, request after request, the operating system may soon say, "I'm getting a `writev` to this socket with... oh, I just saw that memory address when I sent the previous response. I can find that footer string in CPU cache and not bother with RAM."

## Testing

I used [wrk](https://github.com/wg/wrk) to load test these two endpoints. Eg:

    wrk -c2000 -t80 -d30 --timeout 10s http://localhost:4000/static
    wrk -c2000 -t80 -d30 --timeout 10s http://localhost:4000/dynamic

## Results

`/static/` was not faster, and actually looked a little slower (though that could be jitter). ðŸ¤”


===============

With "dynamic", the whole body is crammed into one string in `writev`:


      0    393                    writev:return Writev data 9/10: (416 bytes): 0x0000000017601507 \r\nx-frame-options: SAMEORIGIN\r\nx-xss-protection: 1; mode=block\r\nx-content-type-options: nosniff\r\n\r\nXGGICSJAJJMXQKQXGBFBUUKWDQPCDAUANCHXRJHLZTYNGIZYZAJVHHSNHQXSR\nOFLNFDPQWKPTORVBPFZCKDNLDEWAAKAFKAZOPHIMIQNYADAQQJYRVEKPNTZJCPQ\nQHAROKYUMMRULWJAXTFCSLCOHULOSWD

But with "static", most of the strings (though not all, curiously) are sent individually:
